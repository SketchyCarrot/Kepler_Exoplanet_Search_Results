# Kepler_Exoplanet_Search_Results
ML project completed under Loop Summer Mentorship Program.
In this project, I have trained four models -
1. Logistic Regression
2. Naive Bayes Classifier
3. Random Forst Classifier
4. Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Scored the models with 4 scoring methods - F1, accuracy, precision and recall.
Achieved a score of 1.0 in recall and above 0.983 in all others.
The file has proper explanations accompanied with graphs.
